Well, staying in this hellhole of a county must be worth it.
>Montana, God curse her. The only place where there is taiga that no one dares to check.
>Your name is Anon Y. Moose and one of the greatest goals in your life is about to be achieved.
>18 long years weren't spent in vain.
>You got about a hundred of federal agents on your tail, but here you're completely safe.
>All of you are.
>A full regiment of war veterans and survivalists.
>Equipment was the main concern, however. It was hella hard to get those Tunguskas and Shilkas stolen from warehouses in Eastern Europe, particularly Ukraine, disassembled, shipped to the U.S. and assembled here.
>Portal is ready to be activated. Portal that will take you to your future homeland.
>Equestria.
>All of your "soldiers" are in full equipment, looking tacticool as buck. You couldn't arm them all with assault rifles, so you had to resort to the semi-automatic rifles.
>You also have dozen or so guntrucks, several dozens of regular heavy cars and your personal pride - a heavy bus with GSh-6-23 installed onto it.
>This beauty fires 9250 0.5-pound shells a minute - much better than the one installed onto A-10.
>Head technician stands in the control room, while two parts of the portal gate assemble together.
>"Just like in Doom Eternal intro, hah" - one of the officers says.
"Yep. We'll rip and tear."
"Ha, just joking. I think they'll submit to us second after they see those."
>You point to two reassembled BMP-3s. Worked a lot to get those from the former Yugoslavia.
"Everybody, to the transport!"
"We have to get there until Feds spot an energy surge, so be quick."
>"Yep!" you hear from one of the cars.
>"Colonel, we're ready."
"START IT UP!"
>A flash blinds you
>The portal is up and working. Really looks like this thing in Doom Eternal - a circle of blue light with a black hole in the center.
>It is about three meters in diameter, so all cars and IFVs can pass without a problem.
>You hope onto a BMP and order the driver to move forward.
"Jesus help us!"
>Another flash, then a feeling of being beaten by a rubber truncheon. Just like after a cup of Victory Gin.
>After recovering from your headspin, you find you and your BMP-3 in the middle of some plain. The portal is also here, which is pretty nice.
>Your HT has gone out. It works, but doesn't emit anything except white noise. Probably communications through the portal are impossible.
"Forward! We have to make way for the others."
"You!"
>You point to the gunner.
"Go back and tell the others that we have successfully teleported."
>"Yes, colonel!"
>You hope that this fellow will travel back and forth safely.
>Several minutes of anxious waiting pass. You are almost ready to declare it a lost cause, when the gunner reappears.
>"All is OK, colonel! They are moving through!"
"Great, great!"
>Seconds later, a guntruck appears and immediately starts to move away to clear the path.

>After two hours of intense travelling between dimensions, all of your 'army' is here.
>Those who stayed have locked the facility and attached enough explosives to the portal so it'll go boom at the very second FBI would try to use it.
>First recon confirmed that a large pony city was located seven klicks to the south. Probably the strike won't require much forces.
>You gather your lieutenants to discuss a plan.
>After a short half-an-hour discussion you decide to lead the attack.
>Las Pegasus' name clearly points out that there will be pegasi, so a Tunguska and a Shilka will accompany the strike force.
>A fight in the city will happen, so one of the clearing squads will be also brought.
>It is led by the 1st Lieutenant V. K. Kornilov, a veteran of both Chechen Wars and former SOBR officer. 
>This battle-hardened man of steel was one of the several survivors during the battle of Grozny at the New Year's Eve back in 1995.
>You sometimes wandered what brought him here, to the army of people attempting to capture a world mentioned in a show for children.
>Anyway.
>Kornilov's squad's specialization is city battles. They are armed for this: a lot of assault rifles, pistols, grenades and Molotov cocktails.
>The main force is two "companies" - about 240 men on cars and guntrucks. They are supported by the BTR, whose 14.5-mm KPVT machine gun will be effective against most targets.
>Strike group is ready for the command.
>You climb onto the BTR-80.
>Several minutes pass, as your armoured convoy moves through a rather rough plain. They surely don't know anything about roads here.
>BTR and your newly-bought armoured vehicles are moving significantly faster than the rest of the force. Tunguska also moves fast enogh thanks to its chain tracks.
>The observation helo reports of a large buildings up to 12 stories with bright lights and a lot of activity on the streets.
>Those ponies don't even know what awaits them.
>Helo, bought for a nice price of about 800 grand and armed with two remote-controlled M60s, is ordered to hover above the city. It can probably support the ground attack, but it's far too expensive to waste.
>As the vehicles approach, you see a brightly-lit, noisy city. You even regret this attack for a second.
>But this second passes. There was too much work done to stop at the sight of some city.
>The BTR and another armored vehicle move forward to perform a force recon. After initial contact, main group will follow.
>You notice a railway station on your left. A train is slowing down and is about to arrive.
"Hey, fire a long burst or two on this [spoiler]DAMN TRAIN[/spoiler]!"
>"Commencing an attack, Colonel."
>14.5-mm KPVT gun wakes up like some sort of a steel snake. After a quarter of a second, three dozens of HEI-T bullets pierce the train, smashing the windows and leaving a series of holes.
>Probably someone (nope, you can't force yourself to say "somepony") was killed. You can't really prove this.
>The train starts to slow down, when gunner releases another long burst. Railroad cars stop, doors open, and ponies begin to flee in panic.
>Probably the shots were heard, like, everywhere. Anyway, the vehicles continue to make their way towards the city.
>Main entrypath is flooded with decorated carriages. When their passengers notice green-painted armoured vehicles, they begin to flee in all directions.
"Don't open fire. We have limited ammo, so wasting it on civilians is not a smart idea."
--
"Change your controller to PKM. We have more 7,62s at our disposal and I don't see any targets here that are armoured enough for them to withstand."
>"Aye-aye, colonel."
>Convoy moves through the street slowly, but steadily. Hopefully, there's almost no resistance. The ponies on streets just look at the force with shock and awe.
>Probably you shouldn't be too harsh on these ponies. No one is trying to stop your vehicles, after all. 
>If this happened to any little town in US, you would probably have a full regiment of Delta Force and a couple of hundreds of F-16s over your head with a dozen of Minutemen III pointed to the entire state you'd be in.
>Damn, shouldn't have said this.
>A lone unicorn stallion in ridiculous armor and with spear held by telekinesis runs out of the building to the left.
>"[spoiler]Stop right there, criminal scum! No human invades Equestria on MY watch![/spoiler]"
>"Halt, foreigner! What are you do..."
>His voice slowly fades as three machine guns are now pointed at him.
"Please, get out of the way. I don't want you smashed to the ground by those tracks. They are in fact very heavy!"
>You try to look and sound honest and earnestly.
>Probably the guard understands that he won't be able to do anything against two full companies, but instead of just going away he calls for help.
>More guards appear as they form a line in front of your BTR.
"Please, go away. I don't want casualties."
>"You - YOU are the one who damaged the train!"
>"Hopefully nopony was injured as the railroad car was empty."
>Phew, some good news.
"We have prevalent force, guard. I can eliminate you all with a wave of hand...but I DON'T WANT to."
"Disband or you will face certain consequences."
>You suddenly remember that there is actually a third way.
"Alpha-1, this is Command, message for you, over."
--
>"Command, this is Alpha-1, we read you loud and clear, over."
"Alpha-1, detain the guards that are in front of the convoy. Don't use lethal force if not necessary. Over."
>"Command, copy that. Detaining without use of lethal force. Requesting permission to use special gear. Over."
"Permission granted. Over."
>Second after, two dozens of soldiers in full body gear embark from the armoured cars.
>Instead of assault rifles and shotguns they hold riot shields and heavy batons. After a minute soldiers form a line of shields before your BTR and slowly but steadily push the guards back.
>That looks really weird, but effective. Guards just don't know what to do so their only option is to retreat. 
"Alpha One."
>"Command, this is Alpha One, what is it? Over."
"Maybe we should rename you to the 1st Military Police squad?"
>"Not funny, Moose."
"Just imagine yourself pushing crowds of peaceful ponies instead of dying under spells."
>"I'll think about that."
>While you troll the Alpha-1 commander, his men do a really good job.
>Guards are pushed all the way to the central city square.
"Forward!"
